# B/W Board

This is a simple Black/White Board that allows user to write text on a webpage and displaying it to others, just like a black board or white board. The font size would scale according to input or the display size of the webpage. This is done using a simple binary search algorithm.

This project uses:
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Meyer-Reset (CSS)](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
- [Open-Huninn Font](https://justfont.com/huninn/)
